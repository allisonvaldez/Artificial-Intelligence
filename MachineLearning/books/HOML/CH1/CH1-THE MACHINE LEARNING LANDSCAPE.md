1. **machine learning:** the science and art of programming computers to learn from data

2. **when to use machine learning?**
	- the problem requires solutions that have alot of rules or need alot of fine tuning.
	- the problem is so complex that traditional approaches yeild no good solutions.
	- fluctuating environments
	- getting insights about complex problems with large amounts of data.

3. **categories of machine learning systems**
	- how they are supervised during training: supervised, unsupervised, semisupervised, self supervised 
	- learning by increments or on the fly: online, batch learning
	- working by comparing new data point to known data points or by detecting patterns in the training data and building predictive models: instance based, model based learning

4. **training supervision**
